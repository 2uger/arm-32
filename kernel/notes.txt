Thoughts on locks:
-- Lock in simple way just a mechanism to prevent multiple threads 
    take the same structure to avoid miss read
    (looping over array to find demanding buffer, when find it 
    (other thread take this buffer and change information => phhhh)
-- Make a lock as simple flag to represent is struct using by someone
-- When acquire lock => remove interrupts
    (it's more about interrupt
    (because only after them we will switch to another thread)
    and just update lock counter;
-- When release, make the same but update lock counter in another way
